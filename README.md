Version 0.3.1 (`v.03`).

The browser uses this for HTTP bodies and the profile file. [anvil-image](https://github.com/buntatoes/anvil-image) uses it for PNG and WebP, and uses `crc32` to check PNG chunks. [anvil-video](https://github.com/buntatoes/anvil-video) compresses frame data with it.

## What it does

- `compress_deflate`, `compress_zlib`, `compress_gzip`, and the matching decompress functions.
- The `*_bounded` decompress functions stop if the output would pass the caller's limit. The default limit is 32 MiB (`DEFAULT_MAX_DECOMPRESSED_BYTES`).
- zlib streams are checked with Adler-32. gzip streams are checked with CRC-32 and the ISIZE trailer.
- `crc32` and `adler32` are public.

## What it does not do

- It does not call zlib, libdeflate, or any other compression library.

## Build

```
cargo test
```
